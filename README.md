# Notes/WriteUps/Walkthroughs
A collections of my notes/walkthroughs/writeups for TryHackMe, HackTheBox and other boxes/networks. 

## Writeup Temaplates
Just replace my logo, name and links with your own and then the templates are free for anyone to use.
* [Google Docs Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ViKmi_d4BGNPTo5u_GlZ-yFBXPOwCIJChbg5JNrwE9Y/edit#)
  * Look at my Wreath Report if you want to see the template in use
* [Notion Template](https://hironewf.notion.site/Penetration-Testing-Report-Template-d720d84dc6034cd992caf933cb692b4f) 
  * If you want to export this one as a PDF some editing to the spacing may be needed so that it doesn't look stupid when broken up into pages instead of just one long page like notion is by default
