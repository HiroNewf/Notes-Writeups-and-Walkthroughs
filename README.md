  * If you want to export this one as a PDF some editing to the spacing may be needed so that it doesn't look stupid when broken up into pages instead of just one long page like notion is by default
* [Notion Red Team Engagement Report Template](https://hironewf.notion.site/Red-Team-Engagement-Report-76150bbdd379486e96bce92a8a97323a?pvs=4)
