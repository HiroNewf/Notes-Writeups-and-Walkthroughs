# Notes/WriteUps/Walkthroughs
A collections of my notes/walkthroughs/writeups for TryHackMe HackTheBox and other boxes/networks. 

## Naming scheme 
I will be putting a few different types of documents in this repository so for anyone that is looking at them here are the different types of documents that can be found here and what each one is like.

* Notes = My personal notes that may skip some steps, explain things and then ignore others, etc. Just the notes I think that I need in order to rememeber the information and make my way through the room.
* Walkthroughs = Step by step guide that anyone with some basic hacking skills should be able to follow along with and complete.
* Writeups = A full fledged penetration testing report.

## Writeup Temaplates
Just replace my logo, name and links with your own and then the templates are free for anyone to use.
* [Google Docs Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ViKmi_d4BGNPTo5u_GlZ-yFBXPOwCIJChbg5JNrwE9Y/edit#)
 * Look at my Wreath Report if you want to see the template in use
* [Notion Template](https://hironewf.notion.site/Penetration-Testing-Report-Template-d720d84dc6034cd992caf933cb692b4f) 
  * If you want to export this one as a PDF some editing to the spacing may be needed so that it doesn't look stupid when broken up into pages instead of just one long page like notion is by default
