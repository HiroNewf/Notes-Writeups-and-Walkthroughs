# TryHackMe-Walkthroughs-Writeups
A collections of my notes/walkthroughs/writeups for TryHackMe rooms and networks. 

## Naming scheme 
I will be putting a few different types of documents in this repository so for anyone that is looking at them here are the different types of documents that can be found here and what each one is like.

* Notes = My personal notes that may skip some steps, explain things and then ignore others, etc. Just the notes I think that I need in order to rememeber the information and make my through the room.
* Walkthroughs = Step by step guide that anyone with some basic hacking skills should be able to follow along with and complete.
* Writeups = A full fledged penetration testing report.
